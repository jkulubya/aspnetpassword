# ASP.NET Identity v3 Password Hasher
Use this to generate password hashes from plaintext that match those generated by the algorithm shipped in ASP.NET Identity v3.

## Installation
```
dotnet tool install -g jkulubya.dotnet.hash-identity
```

## Usage
```
$ dotnet hash-identity <text to hash as ASP.NET v3 password>
```

## Why?
I got tired of going through the reset password flow of the apps I was developing whenever I had to change a password. Now I just run this and update the password field in the database.

## Warning
Take care what passwords you input into this tool, because they get saved into your terminal's history.

This tool should get no where near a production machine/database/service/whatever.
